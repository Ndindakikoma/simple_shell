SHELL PROJECT
Objectives There are three objectives to this assignment: To familiarize ourselves with the Linux programming environment.

To learn how processes are created, destroyed, and managed.

To gain exposure to the necessary functionality in shells.

Overview In this assignment, we implemented a command line interpreter or, as it is more commonly known, a shell. The shell should operate in this basic way: when you type in a command (in response to its prompt), the shell creates a child process that executes the command you entered and then prompts for more user input when it has finished.
